<h1>Notes 📝</h1>
This project was my introduction to Node.js, a powerful backend framework. I learned how to set up a server, handle API requests, and interact with the OpenAI API. Integrating the GPT-4 language model into the application was a fascinating challenge. I gained insights into AI-powered natural language processing and how it can enhance user interactions with web applications. I encountered some challenges, like handling CORS, debugging server-side errors, and managing dependencies. However, each challenge taught me valuable lessons and improved my development skills.
